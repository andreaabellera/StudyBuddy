# 27/01/2023
Time: 1:37pm - 2pm
Attendance: Katrina, Ryan, Andrea, Millan, Eli
Agenda: discuss project proposal with TA, discuss architecture diagram and potential technologies
### Discussion
- Andrea went over the project proposal and showed the design mockups
- Andrea presented the architecture diagram
- Decided on using GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline because its simpler
- We sent the repo link to the TA
- Confirmed with TA that we can contact him if we have any future questions
#### TA Suggestions
- Could save time with premade UI library (our UI is very ambitious)
- Java could use Springboot, Python could use either Django or Flask
- NodeJS could also be used for the backend
- RestAPI or GraphQL (with NodeJS)
- DB: could use Postgres or MongoDB
- Cypress focuses mainly on end to end tests. Alternatives: Jest, Testing Library for Vue and NodeJS
- Single vs Server/Client Build: server/client is better because things are decoupled and easier to debug (Docker)
- TA Link:  https://nestjs.com/
### Meeting Summary
- presented project proposal and diagrams to TA
- discussed technologies with TA
- we are on track for sprint 1
- backend needs to decide on technologies by **Saturday** so the architecture diagram can be finalized
